A GitHub Stars web component

[gh-stars.alanwsmith.com](https://gh-stars.alanwsmith.com/)


## The Official Button

This project isn't super necessary given that 
you can get an official button with your star 
count directly on the [GitHub buttons page](https://buttons.github.io/).

I didn't know about that before I started this. Even
though I do now I'm doing to finish my project
to gain some experience with web components (which
will just look nicer on the page anyway).
